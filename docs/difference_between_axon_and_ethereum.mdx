## Mining Related

### `eth_getUncleByBlockHashAndIndex` API
Since Axon uses BFT consensus algorithm, no uncle block exists. The RPC method always returns `null`.

### `eth_getUncleByBlockNumberAndIndex` API
Since Axon uses BFT consensus algorithm, no uncle block exists. The RPC method always returns `null`.

### `eth_getUncleCountByBlockHash` API
Since Axon uses BFT consensus algorithm, no uncle block exists. The RPC method always returns `0x0`.

### `eth_getUncleCountByBlockNumber` API
Since Axon uses BFT consensus algorithm, no uncle block exists. The RPC method always returns `0x0`.

### `eth_mining` API
Since Axon does not mine, this RPC method always returns `false`.

### `eth_coinbase` API
Since Axon does not mine, this RPC method always returns `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`.

### `eth_hashrate` API
Since Axon does not mine, this RPC method always returns `0x1`.

### `eth_submitWork` API
Since Axon does not mine, this RPC method always returns `true`.

### `eth_submitHashrate` API
Since Axon does not mine, this RPC method always returns `true`.

### `Difficulty` opcode
Since Axon does not mine, this opcode always uses `0x1`.

### `gas_price` calculation
Since Axon does not mine, Axon simplifies the process of `gas_price` calculation of [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559) transaction as `gas_price = max(tx.gas_price, tx.max_fee_per_gas)`.

## Wallet Related

### `eth_accounts` API
Since Axon does not mine, this RPC method is not supported.

### `eth_sign` API
Since Axon does not mine, this RPC method is not supported.

### `eth_signTransaction` API
Since Axon does not mine, this RPC method is not supported.

### `eth_sendTransaction` API
Since Axon does not mine, this RPC method is not supported.

### Transactions Root Calculation
The transactions root calculation in Ethereum is as follows:
```rust
let mut trie = Trie::new(memory_db);
for (i, tx) in transactions.iter().enumerate() {
    let key = rlp_encode(&i);
    let val = rlp_encode(&tx);
    trie.insert(key, val);
}
block.header.transactions_root = trie.root();
```

The calculation in Axon is:
```rust
let mut trie = Trie::new(memory_db);
for (i, tx) in transactions.iter().enumerate() {
    let key = rlp_encode(&i);
    let val = rlp_encode(&keccak256(rlp_encode(&tx)));
    trie.insert(key, val);
}
block.header.transactions_root = trie.root();
```
