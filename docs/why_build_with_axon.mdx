Axon facilitates the flow of assets and information between DApps built on different blockchains for a multi-chain future. With Axon, web3 builders can easily transform their ideas into reality. Whatever your project is, whether itâ€™s GameFi, DeFi, or NFT, Axon offers a scalable and cost-effective framework to deploy your applications.



### Universal Abstraction

Axonâ€™s abstraction capacity is derived from the universal CKB, which allows for the construction of any account model and virtual machine instructions. Devs on Axon can load and verify cells through a precompiled contract on CKB-VM, which makes the development of multi-chain, contract wallet, and other applications much easier.



### Highly Interoperable

Axon will soon be fully compatible with Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC)â€”the gateway to the Cosmos ecosystem, and later with all EVM-based blockchains. In addition to these top two thriving networks, Axon will be continually onboarding more protocols.



### High Performance

Axon uses a new Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) based consensus algorithm that supports over 3000 TPS (tested 1000+ TPS on Uniswap V3) across hundreds of nodes with fast transaction finality.



### Easy-to-Deploy

Axon provides a full-fledged toolkit that enables web3 developers to start building right away without having to understand the fundamentals. Designed with a different approach than Relayers, Axon automates off-chain communication, thereby significantly reducing deployment costs.
